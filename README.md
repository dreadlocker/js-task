OOP:
Using OOP principles write code (once in JavaScript and once in PHP) describing the following animals with their corresponding abilities. Code needs to be functioning and executable. Make the code as modular as possible, so other animals can be added later.

•	Sleep – prints “zzz…”
•	Eat – prints “nom nom…”
•	Roar – prints “roar…”
Dolphin can:

Bee can:
